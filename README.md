# Caddy Proxy addon for hass.io


###    ⚠️  MADE BY https://github.com/bestlibre/hassio-addons ⚠️
## **WARNING** : I don't use hass anymore, I've switched to a pure docker installation. This addons are not realy active anymore. I will try to do some small maintenance for some of them when I use them in docker, but that's all. I will try to point to alternatives when possible.


## Caddy Proxy
Caddy proxy with multiple vhosts and automatic ssl : working but not updated anymore
